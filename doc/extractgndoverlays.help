Extract embedded ground overlay images from a KML/KMZ file. Specify an input KML/KMZ file and an output folder. This algorithm does not support network http image references. The images must be a part of the KMZ or a local file referenced by the KML. The compatible images will be converted to GeoTiff images and saved in the output folder. If rotation is involved, the output GeoTIFFs are compatible with QGIS but may not be compatible with other programs. If needed, run these images through "GDAL->Raster projections->Warp" to make them compatible with other programs.
